(3p) Define classes that allow the management of data related to a weather condition (date, temperature, description, location, etc.),
using members of public, private, protected, const, static type. The class contains at least one dynamically allocated field 
(like recorded temperatures array), constructors, 2 accessor methods (set will validate the received value) for an attribute of your choice
and the class destructor.

(1p) Overload the ++ operator with the postfix form that allows you to change the schedule by delaying it by one hour

(1p) Exemplify  the overloading concept for the previously defined set method. 

(1p) Using the previous class,exemplify the three different situations in which the copy constructor is called.

(2p) To exemplify the use of a “has a” type 1: M relation (one to several) by defining an additional class to manage the weather 
conditions for a region with multiple locations. You can use a STL collection but it is not mandatory.

(1p) Overload an operator of your choice to add new weather conditions data for the region.

(1p) Explain how virtualization works. You can use the debugger for that.
